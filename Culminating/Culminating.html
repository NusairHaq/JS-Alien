	<!--   Stuff in my game
	
	The idea behind my game is that you are a gun operator that is responsible to defend communication sattelites, so that people on earth won't be in the dark during the alien invasion
	
	Certain features: 
	
		Algorithms (selection sort and recursion) is implemented in the scores menu, the recursion is used in the drawing of the table and the algorithm sorts the time survived values	
		2d arrays are used in my background, to give a coordinated grid feel to my game 
		Object classification is used with the making of the aliens and satellites. 
		The credit menu is sort of a joke, because obviously I didn't make the pictures for my icons or background, and the credit is given here
		I have a arcade like song to give the game an arcade, retro feel.
		To personalize the game, I let the user input their player name, which is displayed at the start and end of the game
		I have an accurate timer, to the nearest second, made by dividing a value by a certain number based on paint refresh rate
		Difficulty can always be changed by changing the amount of aliens or the fact
		each satellite has its own health value, and will stay alive until this health runs out

  <canvas id="canvas" width="640" height="700"></canvas>

<!-- The Canvas is new to HTML and is currently on track to replace Flash for games etc, Flash is officially a dying language/platform
The canvas element is where our programs will operate, it is the place where we can draw things and be in all ways awesome.

Since you can have multiple canvas elements, each canvas must have a name (you will put this name into your Javascript code), I have named my 
canvas element with the most imaginative name possible, the name is simply "canvas", I could have called it "canvas1" or "canvasGame" but because
I'm only using a single canvas, a cheap-o name will do.
